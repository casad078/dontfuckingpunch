    <h1>Why it started</h1>
    <p>In March, 2024, multiple women shared on social media how they were unpromptedly punched by a man in New York City. <br><br><br>Shockingly, a number of viewers blamed the women for the attacks, stating how the men were only punching women who were distracted by their phones. <br><br><br>Assault and harassment is a constant fear among many women, especially those living in New York during these past few weeks. The fact that it’s become a “trend” to punch women on their phones (multiple people have been reported doing so) is also concerning, and unfortunately there seems to be a number of people who don’t understand that attacking someone isn’t ok. <br><br><br>Women deserve to feel safe on the fucking street.</p>

    <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p><span>DONT FUCKING PUNCH</span> is a social campaign calling out the outrage and  ridiculousness of the situation. It’s  incredible that people have to be reminded not to fucking, and it’s equivocally incredible how many seem to be defending the attackers and blaming these women for being punched. <br><br><br>“They should always be on their phone then.” is a ridiculous argument when you consider that almost everyone has and uses their phone for almost everything. <br><br><br>We aim to bring attention to harassment and abuse on the street, as well as fight against victim blaming and gender bias. Men wouldn’t like being punched either, <span>right?</span></p>

    <h1>Taking action</h1>
    <p>There’s a number of things you can do to help spread awareness on harassment against women. </p>
    <h2>Get Informed</h2>
    <p>Keep yourself in loop with the events going on around you. The news, social media, and social interaction are some of the best ways to stay alert and informed. </p>
    <h2>Share your story and report</h2>
    <p>Sharing your own experiences can help others feel safe enough to come forwards themselves, bringing more awareness to what is happening so other women are alert and prepared. </p>
    <h2>Have discussions</h2>
    <p>Ignorance and disassociation are part of the issue. Having  critical and open conversations with people, of any gender, opens up new support systems where women can feel safe and heard. </p>
